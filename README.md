**Project Scope:** 

* Features of the selected project
    * Create new customers / clients: Users will be able to use the software to open new accounts for new customers or clients with a form that will require all necessary information needed about the customer to open a bank account. The information will be used and stored in the database.
    * Add and modify customer details: Users will be able to make changes to any information to the account of customers which will also be saved and reflected in the database.
    * Balance checking: The software allows bankers to access customer information which involves all account information, account balances and any transactions as well.
    * Deposit Money: The user will be able to use the software to add to customer balance with the deposit money function after the customer hands over the amount of money to the banker in the form of cash.
    * Withdraw Money: The user will be able to check customer balances and perform withdrawals by deducting the amount from their balance and providing the customer with cash.
    * Electronic Transfer Money (ETF): The user will be able to take requests by customers to transfer money to different accounts given the account number of the customer who they are trying to transfer to.
    * Generate Statement of Accounts: The user will be able to generate account statements with transactions, running balances and other details for the customer. 
    * Export Banking Transactions (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, or Custom): Users will be able to handle custom transactions and filter the results by different formats and time frames. This will allow customers to get a more specific view of their account upon request.
    * Store account information (personal details, account balances, etc): Users will be able to access and store information about customers both while creating an account and after creation as well. These details will include all information about the customer‚Äôs account and personal information as well.
    * Store banking transaction (inbound and outbound transfers, deposits, and withdrawals): The user will be able to store customer transactions such as all money coming in and all money going out of the account. Along with this, the user will be able to store amounts debited, credited and interest accumulated as well.
    * Printer connectivity: The user will be able to use the software‚Äôs printer connection feature to be able to connect to a printer and print hard copies of all the mentioned documents and reports above that can be generated by the software user.

They serve as a primary point of contact for customers who need help with account management, transactions, loans, credit cards, and other financial services.
* Integration of the End users with the project (user stories)
    * End Users mentioned above will be able to use the specified features of the project such as managing account information, transactions, collecting information, and performing banking operations.
* Areas covered with this project
    * Account management: The banking system will provide implementing banks with easy user management features such as: 
        * creating account
        * updating information
        * depositing and withdrawing
        * generating reports and statements
    * Transactions: The banking system will provide implementing banks with the ability to efficiently display transactions, sort them, and export them as Statement of Accounts.
    * Banking Operations: The banking system will provide implementing banks with basic banking operations such as depositing, withdrawing, and transferring money.
    * Networking and Data Storage: The banking system will provide implementing banks with the ability to securely store data in a remote database.
    * Connectivity: The banking system will provide implementing banks with the ability to connect to a local printer to print reports.

**Project Users**: 

CashFlow360 will benefit both bankers and their customers respectively for a faster more efficient management system that will streamline the banking operations with a simple and secure method of managing accounts, providing customers with support and details, and closing transaction requests. The software will also allow clerks and other bank employees to easily access customer accounts and provide them with detailed information such as bank balance, statements and even make use of printer connectivity to print and provide the information to its customers. 

**Project Actuator:**

Banking Institutions will play an integral role in the implementation of CashFlow360. As a Modern Day Banking System, banking institutions will have to review and approve the proposed system to have its clients (and staff) benefit from the streamlined features it provides. Without the review and approval of banking institutions, CashFlow360 would not be able to identify the individual and unique features that implementing banking institutions require. For instance, not all banks provide the same banking products to its clients; thus, not all banking institutions will require the same set of features from our system. A real-life example of such a scenario is HSBC‚Äôs ability to instantly transfer funds from any HSBC account in its servicing countries without the need of wire or telegraphic transfer. Furthermore, CIBC provides their clients with the ability to instantly check their Equifax credit score without the need of paying for a credit check nor risking a hard inquiry.

Moreover, Aryan and Jolson are long-time friends (ü§ù) and colleagues (üíº) from the Philippines who both took-up Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with Specialization in Network Engineering at De La Salle University in Manila, Philippines. Both network engineers graduated last 2022 with an undergraduate thesis related to novel-based security protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks.

**Project Actors:** 

CashFlow360‚Äôs is a tool that will be heavily used by both banking Institutions and their respective clients. With the rich features the system provides, both banking staff and clients will benefit from streamlined banking operations, user-friendly experience, and easy onboarding. The banking system takes into account the various day-to-day operations of banking institutions and provides solutions to address their common struggles and challenges in fulfilling the unique banking needs of each client.

To deliver a fully user-friendly experience and ensure easy onboarding, an easy-to-follow user documentation is accompanied in this project. Interested banking institutions will simply have to follow the deployment manual provided in the documentation and supply the user guide to its clients _(if necessary)_. Moreover, banking institutions have the ability to customize the banking system to address their specific needs. For instance, banking institutions can white-label CashFlow360 by incorporating the bank‚Äôs official colors, logo, and branding to the system.
